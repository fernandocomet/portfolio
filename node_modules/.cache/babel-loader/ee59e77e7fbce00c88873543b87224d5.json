I think photography was a good hobby, as I liked it very much I decided to go one step further. So I studied a Master at WorkShopExperience in Madrid for one year, also I bought a Canon EOS 5D Mark III with a fantastic 24-70mm. I think when I bought this camera, it was one of the best of the market (and still now!) Also I have a 50mm from my friend Gabriel, and I made some trials with a 500mm (yes, I like birding!).
