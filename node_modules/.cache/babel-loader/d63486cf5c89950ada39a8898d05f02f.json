This involved production, design, coding, support, trainings and workshops, documentation, creation of new Ad Formats and campaign coordination, giving support for the most known Advertisers and more than 200 agencies in Spain, Europe and Latam markets. I can animate for UX using tools as Principle or After Effects.

I think photography was a good hobby, as I liked it very much I decided to go one step further. So I studied a Master at WorkShopExperience in Madrid for one year, also I bought a Canon EOS 5D Mark III with a fantastic 24-70mm. I think when I bought this camera, it was one of the best of the market (and still now!) Also I have a 50mm from my friend Gabriel, and I made some trials with a 500mm (yes, I like birding!). From this time on I would say I am focused on travel photography, events (worked for ElSerCreativo congress) and landscape. Actually I am selling my my photos online at Getty Images, Shuterstock and Dreamstime. You can see here some prices I won: National Geographic, CapturaConCanon, Berlin Eurostars, FWAPhoto, etc.. I have also some personal projects like making experiments such a steel wool or high speed photography.

I am a curious and restless mind, very interested in everything to the web as we know it. For more than 15 years I have worked in digital and media agencies, in the tech area and as a freelance. I'm interested in design, animation and web programming, especially front. But I also have other concerns such as photography, writing, e-commerce, etc.<br></br>\n              I spend a lot of time studying and researching, then I consider projects where I can carry out what I have learned and even take a walk or try new things. Right now looking for new opportunities and challenges! </p>\n        \n            <img src=\"https://www.fernandocomet.com/img/about/github.png\" width=\"300px\" id=\"fullstack_pic\" alt='github' />\n            <h1 id='fullstack'>Full Stack Developer</h1>\n            <p id='fullstack_txt'>Right now I focus on web development.

I like very much JamStack.</p>\n         \n            <img src=\"https://www.fernandocomet.com/img/about/customerjourney.png\" width=\"300px\" id=\"uxdesigner_pic\" alt='reseaarch'/>\n            <h1 id=\"uxdesigner\">UX Designer & Researcher</h1>\n            <p id='uxdesigner_txt'>As a UX Designer & Researcher: I studied philosophy so my first approach always comes from this area.I make a lot of research in these areas to understand product, customer and user better. I do a lot of sketching before jumping to UX methodologies. I can work with wireframes, user flows, prototyping, testing, usability and overall experience of the application works for the end-user. I have experience in facilitation and also in teaching, I was Teacher Assistant at UX/UI Bootcamp at Ironhack. I am also a member of the Interaction Design Foundation. Besides  I have worked in some UX freelance projects on my own and joining a team. I have written more than 80 articles on Medium, many of them UX related and published by Prototypr and UXPlanet.</p>\n        \n            <img src=\"https://www.fernandocomet.com/img/about/fitur1.png\" width=\"300px\" id=\"animator_pic\" alt='fitur' />\n            <h1 id=\"animator\">UI Animator & Ad Specialist</h1>\n            <p id='animator_txt'>I come from the background of Display Advertising where I worked in Digital Agencies such as Genetsis Partners and Comunica+A first, and then on Adserving as Ad Specialist. For more than  eight at Weborama my work was giving technical support to creative and media agencies. This involved production, design, coding, support, trainings and workshops, documentation, creation of new Ad Formats and campaign coordination, giving support for the most known Advertisers and more than 200 agencies in Spain, Europe and Latam markets. I can animate for UX using tools as Principle or After Effects. And for Ads: I am an expert on Adobe AnimateCC, Google Web Designer and can animate also by code using libraries such as Gsap, Velocity, Anime or Pixi. I am certified by Google on Ads production and I am also using last trends on svg animation.</p>\n        \n            <img src=\"https://www.fernandocomet.com/img/about/puntapaloma.jpg\" width=\"300px\" id=\"photographer_pic\" alt='puntapaloma' />\n            <h1 id=\"photographer\">Photographer</h1>\n            <p id='photographer_txt'>After some years shooting with an old Olimpus of 2Mb, some years ago I won the third price of National Geographic Spain and Ron Brugal with this photo.  The award was a Sony Alpha 70, I bought a 70-300 and started shooting every sunday for four or five years. I think photography was a good hobby, as I liked it very much I decided to go one step further. So I studied a Master at WorkShopExperience in Madrid for one year, also I bought a Canon EOS 5D Mark III with a fantastic 24-70mm. I think when I bought this camera, it was one of the best of the market (and still now!) Also I have a 50mm from my friend Gabriel, and I made some trials with a 500mm (yes, I like birding!). From this time on I would say I am focused on travel photography, events (worked for ElSerCreativo congress) and landscape. Actually I am selling my my photos online at Getty Images, Shuterstock and Dreamstime. You can see here some prices I won: National Geographic, CapturaConCanon, Berlin Eurostars, FWAPhoto, etc.. I have also some personal projects like making experiments such a steel wool or high speed photography.
